**violet** (pronounced /vjɔlɛt/) is a work-in-progress operating system centered around a fully asynchronous and non-blocking architecture. The project is in an early development phase, focused on maturing these architectural foundations into a scalable, general-purpose system for modern hardware.

## Requirements

This project uses [Zig](https://ziglang.org). We recommend using [zvm](https://github.com/tristanisham/zvm) to install and manage Zig versions seamlessly.

> [!NOTE]
> The required Zig version is `0.17.0-dev.1786+75044cb04`.

To run a virtual instance of violet on your host machine, you will also need [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) `11.1.0`.

## Build it yourself

Thanks to violet's build system, compiling an operating system has never been easier.

```bash
zig build -Dboard=<BOARD>
```

See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for a complete list of supported boards. Not specifying any board will create a generic image for a given architecture (default to the host machine) :

```bash
zig build -Darch=<ARCH>
```

Supported architectures are `aarch64`, `riscv64` and `x86_64`.

### Running it on QEMU

To instantly build and boot the OS in a virtual machine, simply type:

```bash
zig build run -Darch=<ARCH>
```
